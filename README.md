# Pentago
Play the two-player game of Pentago. Be the first to get 5 in a row. 
Pentago is played on a 6 by 6 board, divided into four 3 by 3    
quadrants.  There are two players, X and O, who alternate turns. 
The goal of each player is to get five of their pieces in a row, 
either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.                  
                                                                 
Players take turns placing one of their pieces into an empty     
space anywhere on the board, then choosing one of the four       
board quadrants to rotate 90 degrees left or right.              
                                                                 
If both players get five in a row at the same time, or the       
last move is played with no five in a row, the game is a tie.    
If a player makes five a row by placing a piece, there is no need
to rotate a quadrant and the player wins immediately.

For each move provide four inputs:                               
   row (A-F), column (1-6), quadrant (1-4), rotation direction (L or R) 
For instance input of B32R places the next piece at B3 and then  
would rotate quadrant 2 (upper-right) to the right (clockwise).
